<!-- 
    With strong interpolation you can even call a method that returns a string,
    the only thing is that you must return a string or something that can be easily
    converted into a string like a number or boolean. No block code is allowed, 
    although you can use ternary expressions.

    [ngStyle] only works through property binding. We pass a JS object to it with the keys being a
    style and the value being an expression we wish to execute. Style must be cammelCase.

    [ngClass] only adds a CSS class if the method attatched evaluates to true.

<p
  [ngStyle]="{ backgroundColor: getColor() }"
  [ngClass]="{ online: serverStatus === 'online' }"
>
  {{ "Server" }} with an ID of {{ serverId }} is currently
  {{ setStatus() }}
</p>
